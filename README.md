# Local Weather
Free Code Camp Intermediate Project.
This project requires an API to obtain weather information based on the current location.

The jQuery $.ajax() API call method was used to differentiate the $.getJSON method call from my previous project the 'Random Quote Generator'. ES6 syntax - combination of arrow functions and string interpolation was used along jQuery.

Shout out again to my mentor, Tony Johnson, for providing guidance to the structure and logic. 
The biggest challenge was the logic to get the date to display in the correct format. A function call within another function was effectively the main key this logic.

After getting that to function, I've discovered that there's a javascript file that works with date format. Well, it was a good learning experience after all.

### About the App
This app provides the users the current weather information based on the current geo-location.
These information include the current locatoin, date, weather information/description, humidity, Wind Speed and Fahrenheit. The users also have the ability to switch between celsius and fahrenheit.
